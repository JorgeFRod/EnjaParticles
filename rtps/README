RTPS: Real-Time Particle Systems
A framework library for developing particle systems.
We currently working on support for 
    Simple particle systems
    SPH Fluid simulation
    Boid simulation



Build:
We use CMake to build the library and compile a standalone test application
Check CMake for library dependencies (OpenCL, OpenGL, GLEW)

We encourage an out-of-source build, so in the base directory of the repo do:
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make

the library will be in rtpslib/

if you have Doxygen you can generate docs:
    make doc

the docs will be in rtpslib/html



Usage:

You can execute the test program like:
./test/test.x

The test program has simple mouse interaction:
Left-Click and drag to rotate the view
Right-Click and drag to zoom in and out

hit Q or ESC to exit (right now clicking the x on the window will not properly clean up GPU memory...)

RTPS: Real-Time Particle Systems
A framework library for developing particle systems.
We currently working on support for 
    Simple particle systems
    SPH Fluid simulation
    Boid simulation



Build:
see INSTALL file

Usage:

You can execute the test program like:
./test/test.x

The test program has simple mouse interaction:
Left-Click and drag to rotate the view
Right-Click and drag to zoom in and out

hit Q or ESC to exit (right now clicking the x on the window will not properly clean up GPU memory...)

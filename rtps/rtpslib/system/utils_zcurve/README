Error with sort: must be related somehow to memory problem. 
Do not know where though? Perhaps premature deallocation of memory?

Oct. Got it. Number of particles must be a power of two. So MUST IMPlement early 
termination. However, that is true for bitonic (and perhaps) radix sort. 
It should not affect hashing in any way!

In GridParam: store actual number of particles.
In Settings: store max number of particles (power of two).

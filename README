    ### EnjaParticles in C++ using OpenCL and OpenGL interoperability

rtpslib/
    RTPS: Real-Time Particle Systems
    A framework library for developing particle systems.
    We currently working on support for 
        Simple particle systems
        SPH Fluid simulation
        Boid simulation



    Build:
    see INSTALL file

    Usage:

    You can execute the test program like:
    ./test/test.x

    The test program has simple mouse interaction:
        Left-Click and drag to rotate the view
        Right-Click and drag to zoom in and out
    and keyboard:
        r - add particles
        p - print timings of various functions
        w, a, s, d - move around like FPS controls
        t - add in some triangles to collide against


    hit Q or ESC to exit (right now clicking the x on the window will not properly clean up GPU memory...)








cmake/
    cmake modules to help find necessary libraries

environment/
    scripts to set the environment variables for using this project
    with my BGEnjaParticles project
    http://github.com/enjalot/BGEnjaParticles

enjacl/
    my first attempt at making a particle system, deprecated
    the particle system library as well as a main.cpp to run it
    check the README in enjacl for build instructions and more info

Simple OpenGL Particle system written in C

No physics yet... just figured out enough interaction between Java and C to get to work

to build:
#build the C files (found in jni folder)
ndk-build
#build the java stuff
ant debug
#move to phone or use -e instead of -d for emulator
adb -d install bin/EnjaParticles-debug.apk

I use ddms command to capture log output from my app, just add a tag filter for EnjaParticles so you can get useful output

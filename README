Simple OpenGL Particle system written in C

No physics yet... just figured out enough interaction between Java and C to get to work

built against android-7 (must have 2.1 to run)
to build:
#build the C files (found in jni folder)
ndk-build
#build the java stuff
ant debug
#move to phone or use -e instead of -d for emulator
adb -d install bin/EnjaParticles-debug.apk

I use ddms command to capture log output from my app, just add a tag filter for EnjaParticles so you can get useful output

#Particle System
particles are emitted from a generator (initialized as a static array)
several static arrays govern the behavior of the particles
the position of the particles is stored in static vertices array
    vertices array is used to draw the particles
    colors array determines color of each particle, with seperate alpha array that updates it

#TODO
//make an actual particle system
    better paramaterization for elements of the system
    make consistant way for variables to depend on time
    add physical interaction
2d texture effects
timing to measure costs of effects and compare devices
rewrite in c++? maybe I can avoid weird JNI hack for passing floats
write a version for OpengGL ES 2.0 with shaders to make pretty effects
get OpenCL running on a phone ;D

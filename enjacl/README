EnjaParticle
OpenCL accelerated particle system. The idea is that this library can take in a generator (emitter)
and create an opencl/opengl context to compute and update a particle system stored in a VBO (vertex buffer object)

Before long it should be inserted into the Blender Game Engine where it will act upon an object that has the Enja
modifier (currently a simple custom modifer), use it's Mesh data as the generator and then display the particles.

Collision detection on the GPU is the next goal after that.


File breakdown
enja.h:
    defines EnjaParticle class

enja.cpp:
    defines the routines that are called by host program
    executes opencl kernel with update routine

opencl.cpp:
    defines the opencl functions needed for EnjaParticle class

incopencl.h:
    include all the necessary OpenCL and OpenGL headers

util.h/cpp:
    function for opening .cl source files
    2 nvidia helper functions

enja.cl:
    OpenCL kernel functions which do the heavy lifting


CMakeLists.txt:
    cmake file for building the project, cross-platform tested on Ubuntu and Mac OS X.
    eventually I'll have to support windows...

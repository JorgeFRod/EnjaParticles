64-bit OpenCL version of cublas (which is 32bit)
In both cases, we are compiling in 32-bit mode (relates to address space)

in the file float_type.h, 

#define DOUBLE
to use doubles on the GPU

#undef DOUBLE
to use doubles on the GPU
----------------------------------------------------------------------
 I cannot get FLOAT to be recognized!! Reasons unknown.

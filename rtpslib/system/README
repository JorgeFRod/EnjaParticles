OUTER.cpp : handles objects defined by point clouds moving inside the 
  fluid. For now these objects are rigid, but that could changed if combined
  with rigging. 

unsorted pos of fluid: not scaled. 
unsorted pos of cloud: not scaled 

permute fluid: do not scale/unscale pos_s 
cloud_permute: scale cloud_pos to simulation space (*0.05)
    cloud_pos_s = 0.05 * cloud_pos_u

Euler: unsorted pos = unsorted pos / scale; // scale=0.05
   p /= scale;

where did we have pos_s *= scale?

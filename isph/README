Project ISPH
============

    Cross-platform CFD library for mesh-free simulation and 
    visualization of incompressible flows using Smoothed Particle 
    Hydrodynamics (SPH) methods.

Folder Structure
----------------

    /isph
        /bin        compiled tools
        /build      build and IDE project files
        /data       test and other data
        /doc        library (doxygen) and tools documentation
        /isphlib    library sources
        /lib        compiled library files
        /tools      tools sources


Requirements
------------

    For successful compilation you'll need the following installed on
    your system:

    - OpenCL SDK and drivers


    Since there is no integrated visualization engine at the moment,
    we suggest you post-process simulated data with:

    - ParaView Meshless


Supported Operating Systems
---------------------------

    - Linux 2.6
    - Windows XP, Vista, 7
    - Mac OS X 10.6

    Other operating systems may work but are not tested.


Supported Compilers
-------------------

    - MSVC 9 and newer
    - GCC 4.0 and newer

    Other standard C++ compilers should work but are not tested.
